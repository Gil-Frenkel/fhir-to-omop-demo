# Notes

This folder is a working location for the development of `jq` module features
before they are ready for inclusion in the `fhir-jq` project.

## Credits

The `jq` documentation is great, but it's a bit lacking on details for the
custom modules feature.  I found the [jq-and-openapi] demo to be extremely
helpful in understanding how a custom `jq` module is written and used. This
repo is used in the corresponding [blog post].
